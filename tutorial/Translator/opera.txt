# Mother Goose Nursery Rhyme - The Man Who Had Naught
#
There was a man and he had naught,
  And robbers came to rob him;
He crept up to the chimney pot,
  And then they thought they had him.

But he got down on t'other side,
  And then they could not find him;
He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,
  And never looked behind him.
