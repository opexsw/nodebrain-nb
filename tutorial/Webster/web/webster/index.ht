<p><h1>Caboodle Home Page</h1>
<p>This is a default Webster home page for a NodeBrain configuration directory we call a <i>caboodle</i>.  It is the working directory of a NodeBrain agent.  In this case, it is an agent with a node using the Webster node module (plug-in).
<p>You are encouraged to replace this file to provide your own caboodle documentation for display within the Webster interface.
