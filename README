See NEWS for a list of changes in this release.

======================================================================== 

Installation instructions for Linux/Unix Platforms

a) From source code distribution - install to /usr/local directories

     $ tar -xzf nodebrain-0.9.03.tar.gz
     $ cd nodebrain-0.9.03
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make check
     $ make install

   To get a list of configure script options use --help.

     $ ./configure --help

   You can exclude NodeBrain modules (plugins) from a build using
   a --disable-nb_<module> parameter.  Examples for the Peer and
   Webster modules are illustrated here.

     $ ./configure --disable-nb_peer
     $ ./configure --disable-nb_webster

   To exclude features and components that depend on openssl, add the
   configure script parameter --without-tls.
     
     $ ./configure --without-tls

   This will exclude the following API's from the NodeBrain library:

     nbTls      - Abstraction of SSL/TLS layer provided by OpenSSL.
                  (GnuTLS may be supported also in a future release.)

     nbPeer     - Non-blocking data transport between NodeBrain agents
 
     nbProxy    - Message page forwarding for proxies.

     nbMsg      - Decoupled event streams with reliable one-time delivery

     nbWebster  - Interface for HTTPS communication

   It also excludes the following modules that depend on one or more
   of these excluded API's.

     nb_mail    - SMTP send and receive

     nb_message - Message stream producer, consumer, client and server
 
     nb_webster - Minimal web server for caboodle administration

b) From git repository - requires autoconf/automake/libtools

     $ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/nodebrain/nb nodebrain-nb
     $ cd nodebrain-nb
     $ git checkout 0.9.03
     $ ./autogen.sh
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make check
     $ make install

c) To install to an alternate location (replace last step of a or b)

     $ make install DESTDIR=$HOME/usr

d) To create an RPM file instead of installing (on rpm based build machine)

     $ make rpm      [this replaces the make install step]

e) Build binary RPM from source RPM file 

     $ rpmbuild --rebuild nodebrain-0.9.03-1.el6.src.rpm
     $ rpmbuild --rebuild nodebrain-0.9.03-1.src.rpm

f) Install from binary RPM file (x86_64 platform example)

     $ rpm --install nodebrain-0.9.03-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
     $ rpm --install nodebrain-0.9.03-1.x86_64.rpm

======================================================================== 

This release was tested primarily on a CentOS 6.5 x86_64 platform.

The Coverity Scan service is used to check for common defects.

The openSUSE Build Service is used to test builds for varius Linux
distributions on x86_64, i586, and armv7I architectures. There are
still some package policy warnings to resolve.  A "make check" is
part of the package build process, providing a light level of testing
on each platform.

Architecture:

  x86_64          Pass - All OS's showing pass below
  i586            Pass - RHEL 7, CentOS 7, Scientific Linux 7, and
                         SLE_12 not tested
  armv7i          Pass - only openSUSE Factory tested

Build Tested Operating Systems:

  rpm Fedora      Pass - 20, 19, 18, 17
  rpm RHEL        Pass - 7, 6, 5 
  rpm CentOS      Pass - 7, 6, 5
  rpm Scientific  Pass - 7, 6

  rpm openSUSE    Pass - 13.2, 13.1, 12.3, 12.2, Factory, Factory_ARM
  rpm SLE         Pass - 12, 11_SP3, 11_SP2, 11_SP1, 11, 10_SDK

  deb Debian      Pass - 7, 6
  deb xUbuntu     Pass - 14.10, 14.04 13.10, 12.10, 12.04, 11.10
  deb Univention  Pass - 3.2, 3.1

      Mac OS X    Pass - 10.10.1 Yosemite outside Xcode

UNIX Operating Systems:

Early versions were tested on serveral flavors of UNIX include HP-UX,
Solaris, NCR Teradata, Sequent, IRIX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and
more.  So you can probably build on today's UNIX systems, with the
successful Max OS X build providing additional evidence. Please give 
it a try and provide feedback.  Would be happy to make adjustments
if needed.

Windows Not Currently Supported:

The Windows port has fallen behind and is not current supported.  Will
start porting again if there is sufficient interest.
