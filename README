Installation Instructions for Linux/Unix Platforms

a) From source code distribution - install to /usr/local directories

     $ tar -xzf nodebrain-0.9.00.tar.gz
     $ cd nodebrain-0.9.00
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make check
     $ make install

b) From binary RPM file (x86_64 platform example)

     $ rpm --install nodebrain-0.9.00-1.x86_64.rpm

c) From source RPM file 

     $ rpmbuild --rebuild nodebrain-0.9.00-1.src.rpm

======================================================================== 

Although prior releases of NodeBrain were tested on various platforms,
at time of release this version has only been tested on RHEL 6.4, x86_64.
It should work on other Linux platforms, and be relatively easy to port
to Unix platforms.  The project has stopped porting to Windows, and the
conditional compilation for Windows is no longer expected to work.  We
hope to support Windows again at some future release, but it is not a
high priority at this time.
