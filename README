======================================================================== 

Installation instructions for Linux/Unix Platforms

a) From source code distribution - install to /usr/local directories

     $ tar -xzf nodebrain-0.9.03.tar.gz
     $ cd nodebrain-0.9.03
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make check
     $ make install

   To get a list of configure script options use --help.

     $ ./configure --help

   You can exclude NodeBrain modules (plugins) from a build using
   a --disable-nb_<module> parameter.  Examples for the Peer and
   Webster modules are illustrated here.

     $ ./configure --disable-nb_peer
     $ ./configure --disable-nb_webster

   To exclude features and components that depend on openssl, add the
   configure script parameter --without-tls.
     
     $ ./configure --without-tls

   This will exclude the following API's from the NodeBrain library:

     nbTls      - Abstraction of SSL/TLS layer provided by OpenSSL.
                  (GnuTLS may be supported also in a future release.)

     nbPeer     - Non-blocking data transport between NodeBrain agents
 
     nbProxy    - Message page forwarding for proxies.

     nbMsg      - Decoupled event streams with reliable one-time delivery

     nbWebster  - Interface for HTTPS communication

   It also excludes the following modules that depend on one or more
   of these excluded API's.

     nb_mail    - SMTP send and receive

     nb_message - Message steam producer, consumer, client and server
 
     nb_webster - Minimal web server for caboodle administration

b) From git repository - requires autoconf/automake/libtools

     $ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/nodebrain/nb nodebrain-nb
     $ cd nodebrain-nb
     $ git checkout 0.9.03
     $ ./autogen.sh
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make check
     $ make install

c) To install to an alternate location (replace last step of a or b)

     $ make install DESTDIR=$HOME/usr
     $ make install DESTDIR=/usr

d) To create an RPM file instead of installing

     $ make rpm      [this replaces the make install step]

e) Build binary RPM for source RPM file 

     $ rpmbuild --rebuild nodebrain-0.9.03-1.el6.src.rpm
     $ rpmbuild --rebuild nodebrain-0.9.03-1.src.rpm

f) Install from binary RPM file (x86_64 platform example)

     $ rpm --install nodebrain-0.9.03-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
     $ rpm --install nodebrain-0.9.03-1.x86_64.rpm

======================================================================== 

This release was tested primarily on a CentOS 6.5 x86_64 platform.

The Coverity Scan service is used to check for common defects.

The openSUSE Build Service is used to test builds for varius Linux
distributions on x86_64, i586, and armv7I architectures. There are
still some package policy warnings to resolve.  A "make check" is
part of the package build process, providing a light level of testing
on each platform.

Architecture:

  x86_64          Pass - All OS's showing pass below
  i586            Pass 
  armv7I          Pass - build only - openSUSE cache segfault

Operating System:

  rpm Fedora      Pass 20, 19, 18, 17
  rpm RHEL        Pass 7, 6, 5 
  rpm CentOS      Pass 7, 6, 5
  rpm Scientific  Pass 7, 6

**All SuSE platforms are getting a segfault in mail if not the libedit issue
  rpm openSUSE    Pass TumbleWeed
  rpm openSUSE    Pass Factory, Factory-Arm
  rpm openSUSE    Pass 13.2, 13.1, 12.3, 12.2, 12.1
  rpm SLE         Pass 12, 11 SP1, 11
  rpm SLE         FAIL 11 SP3, 11 SP2, 10   - libedit issues 

  deb Debian      Pass 7, 6
  deb xUbuntu     Pass 14.10, 14.04 13.10, 12.10, 12.04
  deb Univention  Pass 3.2, 3.1
