Sample code and input/output examples are displayed in a monospace font, indented in HTML and Info, and enclosed
in a box in PDF or printed copies.
Bold text is used to bring the reader's attention to specific portions of an example.
In the following example, the first and last line are associated with the host shell and the lines in between are input or output unique to NodeBrain.
The @code{define} command is highlighted, indicating it is the focus of the example.
Lines ending with a backslash \ indicate when a command is continued on the next displayed line.
This is supported by the language within source files, but not for other methods of command input.
If you copy an example of a command displayed over multiple lines, you must enter it as a single
line when used outside the context of a source file.
