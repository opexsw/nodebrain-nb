Description: NodeBrain Rule Engine
 NodeBrain is a rule engine for construction of state and event monitoring
 applications. It interacts with other monitoring components to perform
 simple element state monitoring or complex event correlation based on user
 specified rules. It is extended through the development of plug-in modules
 using the C API, and servant programs written in any language that interact
 with the rule engine via stdin, stdout, and stderr. The package includes a
 small set of plug-in modules to provide capabilities typically required for
 monitoring applications.
