Installation Instructions for Windows

Version 0.7 has not been ported to Windows yet.  You will need to use
0.6.5 on Windows and follow these instrucutions.

The best way to install on a Windows platform is to obtain a Windows
distribution file.  A binary distribution with a Microsoft Installer (MSI)
file is provided for easy installation, and a source distribution is 
provided with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 C++ project workspace.

     nb-0.6.5-win.2k-x86.setup.zip    (binary)
     nb-0.6.5-source.msdsw.zip        (source)

If you are installing from the standard source only distribution on a
Windows platform and want to use Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 to compile,
use the following settings.

  o  nb  

     Project type:   Win32 Console Application
     Link libraries: ws2_32.lib advapi32.lib librxspencer.lib

     You may obtain librxspencer.lib from gnuwin32.source.net
     download package RegEx-Spencer.  You may substitute a
     compatible RegEx library if you have a preference.
 
  o  nb_mod_console.dll
     nb_mod_netflow.dll
     nb_mod_servant.dll
     nb_mod_simple.dll
     nb_mod_snmptrap.dll
     nb_mod_syslog.dll
     nb_mod_translate.dll
     nb_mod_tree.dll

     Project type:   Win32 Dynamic-Link Library
     Link libraries: nb.lib msvcrt.lib  
     Link options:   /nodefaultlib:"libcmt.lib"

     You will need to build nb before linking skill modules.
     Qualify the nb.lib as necessary so the linker can
     find the one your built.

Version 0.6.5 has only been built on Windows XP.
